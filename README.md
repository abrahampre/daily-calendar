# Work Day Scheduler

GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule         
WHEN I open the planner            
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar                                                         
WHEN I scroll down             
THEN I am presented with time blocks for standard business hours    
WHEN I view the time blocks for that day    
THEN each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future   
WHEN I click into a time block  
THEN I can enter an event   
WHEN I click the save button for that time block    
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage  
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist
